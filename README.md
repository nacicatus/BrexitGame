# BrexitGame

A Brexit-inspired dodging game for Boris Johnson!
Featuring "The Brexit Song" by John Oliver's team at Last Week Tonight, the Ghost of David Cameron, Michael Gove sticking his neck out, and a vociferous Jean-Claude Juncker handing out stars!
Warning! This game is political satire! also contains explicit lyrics so it's probably NSFW. Do  wear headphones while trying it out in Simulator.

Still need to fix graphics, icons and sound effects. So pardon the rawness of it all.
